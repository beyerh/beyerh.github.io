## Experiment I: Molecular Cloning of Bacterial Inducible Plasmids

**Supervisors:** Dominic Schirmer, Josepha Grewer, Micail David Müller

Constructing recombinant genes within plasmids facilitates their recovery, *ex vivo* genetic engineering, and shuttling into different desired strains or hosts. Recombinant DNA technologies represent the foundation for generating constitutive or inducible expression systems for the study of heterologous genes in different systems of interest.

In this first experimental part, we will design the required vectors for Experiment III, the design of protein logic gates based on protein *trans*-splicing in bacteria. For this purpose, we will use two different molecular DNA cloning techniques: 

**A. Restriction and ligation cloning.** This technique relies on the presence of restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites flanking the desired insert and at the specified locations within the recipient plasmid. The REs will generate double-stranded DNA cuts, resulting in either cohesive or blunt ends in both DNA sequences through two independent reactions. Subsequently, the digested fragments will be purified and ligated using T4 DNA ligase, an enzyme that facilitates the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent 5’ phosphate and 3’-OH ends. This process will occur prior to the transformation of chemically competent *E. coli* TOP10 bacterial cells for subsequent plasmid amplification and selection. The T4 DNA ligase will thus conduct the repair of the broken DNA, culminating in the assembly of the desired new vector (**[Figure 13](#fig:cloning-strategy)**).

**B. Advanced Quick Assembly (AQUA) Cloning.** In contrast to conventional restriction/ligation cloning, this technique allows us to design a vector independently of the presence of suitable RE sites or the use of DNA restriction enzymes and ligases. This versatile and inexpensive technique relies on *in-vivo* DNA recombination within *E. coli* and therefore requires DNA fragments that share homologous overlapping regions of 20-60 bp at the junction sites. The homology region can, for example, be generated by PCR using appropriate primers that add these sequences to the products (**[Figure 13](#fig:cloning-strategy)**). AQUA Cloning can also be used to clone multiple DNA fragments simultaneously, reminiscent of other “DNA assembly cloning” methods. Additionally, a combination of restriction of the backbone and PCR amplification of the insert (as we will see in our exercise) can be used.

Each group will perform one ligation and one AQUA cloning experiment from one of the four plasmids:

- Groups 1 and 2: pDD259.
- Groups 3 and 4: pDD260.
- Groups 5 and 6: pDD261.
- Groups 7 and 8: pDD262.

As outlined in **[Figure 12](garden_02-Background.md#fig:sleeping-beauty)**, we will first perform a PCR reaction to amplify: (i) The gene encoding the fluorescent protein mCherry interrupted by the full-length *Npu*DnaE intein gene (Int); (ii) The mCherry gene was disrupted by a mutated (non-functional) version of the intein; (iii) A DNA fragment encoding an N-terminal portion of mCherry (mChN) fused to an N-terminal split-fragment of the intein (IntN); and (iv) a DNA fragment encoding a C-terminal portion of mCherry (mChC) fused to a C-terminal split-fragment of the intein (IntC). The destination vectors will be digested overnight with the annotated restriction enzymes to generate the so-called vector “backbones” (this step will be performed by the supervisors in advance).

After gel purification of the PCR products, we will need to digest the PCR product with the same enzymes as the destination vectors to clone the genes via ligation cloning. We will then prepare a pre-mix with a 3:1 molar ratio of the corresponding fragments (insert:backbone). For the restriction/ligation protocol, remember to add T4 DNA ligase and the corresponding buffer! Following ligation, competent Top10 *E. coli* cells are transformed with the recombinant plasmids and subsequently spread on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics, thus facilitating the selection of positive transformants.

The engineered vectors will be purified and analyzed using analytical restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. We encourage you to consider beforehand which enzymes we could use to differentiate the restriction pattern expected for the original plasmids and that resulting from the digestion of the engineered vectors.

Finally, we will select putatively correct samples and analyze them by Sanger sequencing.

A third insert amplified from pDD002 with the primer oDD564 and oDD565 will be cloned into pHBBAD090 backbone, previously digested with *Nde*I and *Hin*dIII, to obtain pDD261. The primers add the required homology regions to the digested vector backbones during the PCR reaction. Alternatively, the PCR products can be digested using the indicated enzymes for ligation cloning. Both approaches result in the same vectors. The * symbol represents the location of the C1A mutation in pDD262.
