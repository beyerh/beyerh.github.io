Take the opportunity to ask as many questions as you would like during the course. All experiments provide ample room for discussion among students and between students and supervisors.\nProtocol\nKeep constant documentation of your work. You will need all the information for your protocol. The final protocol must include all experimental parts, and they must be introduced scientifically. The protocol must further comprise raw and analyzed results, which should be presented in a comprehensive format (e.g., Tables, Figures, Schemes, etc.) with clear labels. Each experiment requires a discussion of the results. When referencing other works, these must be clearly cited.\nInformation on protocols\nKeep constant documentation of your work.

		"content": "Background\nProtein Switches\nProteins constitute a group of macro-biomolecules that provide cells with unique functions essential for life. Comprising one or several chains of amino acids, proteins adopt complex 3-dimensional shapes serving as scaffolds for their biological role. Within organisms, proteins act, for example, as biocatalysts involved in cell metabolism or homeostasis (e.g., replication of the genome, energy conversion, protein synthesis, signal propagation). Proteins further provide structure to cells and organisms, engage in intra- and extracellular communication (cell signaling cascades, hormones, receptors and ligands, transporters, etc.), or regulate each other (feedback loops, induction of events such as transcription, translation, polymerization, mobility, etc.). Due to the wide range of different biological functions inherent to natural proteins, they offer unique opportunities for engineering novel protein-based functions, for example, using synthetic biology-inspired approaches.\nEngineered Protein Switches and Optogenetics\nInducible gene expression switches are an example of engineered protein switches. Chemically controlled molecular switches have played a central role in the fundamental study of life, and the emergence of synthetic biology. They have become routine tools in cell biology research and industry (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3.\nTetracycline-inducible gene expression switch based on an engineered\nprotein switch, the reversed tetracycline transactivator (rtTA). The\nengineered “reversed” bacterial repressor protein rTetR binds to a\ncognate operator DNA sequence (Tet-response element, TRE) in the\npresence of the antibiotic tetracycline. rTetR is fused to a viral\ntransactivator VP16 which induces gene expression from a minimal\npromoter (Pmin) upon DNA binding to induce transcription of a gene of\ninterest (goi).\n\nNote: the natural bacterial tetracycline repressor protein TetR acts as a repressor of transcription in gram-negative bacteria and releases DNA in the presence of tetracycline to induce the expression of resistance genes (TetR, the repressor; and TetA, the protein that pumps antibiotic tetracycline extracellularly).\n\nHowever, drawbacks inherent to small molecules like tetracycline, such as difficulties in removing the inducer and diffusion-based transport, have prevented rapid reversibility and spatially-resolved activation. In contrast, light offers unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, the development of light-controlled devices is highly desirable and has recently received much attention, resulting in a variety of different light-controlled tools in bacteria and yeast as well as in mammalian cells. These control diverse cellular activities, including gene expression.\nThe first light-controlled molecular tools were constructed by introducing photo-cleavable inhibiting chemical groups into inducers, nucleic acids, and transactivators that could be cleaved off in response to UVB light. However, a significant disadvantage of this method is the need to exogenously apply the caged molecules or to reprogram the translation machinery for the incorporation of non-natural amino acids. This disadvantage has been overcome by the optogenetic approach that combines optical and genetic methods to develop light-responsive tools. The first breakthrough in mammalian optogenetics was the discovery of microbial opsins and their subsequent introduction in neuroscience, which revolutionized the study of neuronal networks. Channelrhodopsin, the first opsin that was applied in mammalian neurons, becomes permeable to cations upon blue light illumination, thus triggering neuronal activation. Later, channelrhodopsin was complemented by other ionotropic receptors, including the orange light-responsive, chloride pump halorhodopsin, which made it possible to use dual‑wavelength control to excite or inhibit neurons with subcellular resolution, even in intact brain tissue and in moving animals. Moving beyond neuroscience, more recent optogenetic tools have been engineered to control diverse signaling processes on the protein level in mammalian cells, including gene expression and protein stability, subcellular localization of proteins, receptor and kinase activity, organelle movement, etc. To this end, photoreceptors from all kingdoms of life that naturally sense environmental light information by responding to light of distinct regions of the light spectrum have been employed as engineering scaffolds based on modulating protein-protein interactions, or protein conformation in response to light stimulation (Müller et al., 2015). Figure 4 illustrates two photoreceptors that are frequently employed in optogenetic protein engineering approaches.\n\nFigure 4.\nPhotoswitchable domains frequently used for optogenetic\nengineering. A) A. thaliana Phytochrome B (PhyB)\nphotoreceptor. Red light (R) induces a conformational change in PhyB via\na bound linear billin chromophore (not shown), allowing it to\nheterodimerize with Phytochrome-Interacting-Factor 6 (PIF6). Far-red\nlight (FR) induces the dissociation of the PhyB/PIF6 complex.\nB) Light-Oxygen-Voltage LOV2 domain of Avena\nsativa phototropin 1 uses a flavin mononucleotide (FMN, not\nillustrated) to sense blue light. Photoexcitation leads to relaxation of\nhelix Jα, which rewinds in darkness. AsLOV2 is often used\neither to cage peptides in the dark state (top), or when inserted into\nother proteins, to induce structural remodeling upon light treatment\nwhich influences the function of the target protein.\n\nProtein Splicing\nProtein splicing is a natural phenomenon catalyzed by autocatalytic protein domains called inteins (internal proteins). Inteins reside within other proteins, usually close to the active site of proteins, which are essential for the fitness of a given organism. After translation, inteins autocatalytically excise themselves from the precursor protein and covalently ligate the flanking protein sequences (exteins) with a regular peptide bond, a process called protein cis-splicing, thereby functionally reconstituting the sequence of the host proteins (Figure 5A).\n\nFigure 5.\nProtein splicing in cis and trans. A)\nAfter protein synthesis, protein cis-splicing leads to the\nself-catalyzed excision of an intein from a precursor protein and the\ncovalent ligation of the flanking extein sequences. B)\nIn protein trans-splicing, the association of split intein fragments\n(IntN and IntC) initiates reconstitution of the intein and triggers\nprotein splicing in trans, leading to the ligation of individual\npolypeptides.\n\nLittle is known about the biological relevance of inteins and therefore, they are mainly seen as selfish genetic elements capable of inserting into protein-encoding genes. Because inteins tend to insert into genes encoding essential proteins with a high degree of conservation, they may be maintained within populations as long as they sufficiently catalyze their self-removal, thereby escaping genetic drifts. However, it seems plausible that some inteins might act as environmental sensors and regulate the activity of their host proteins accordingly (e.g., reduce the growth rate under stress conditions). From genome-mining approaches, split inteins have been identified which can ligate individual polypeptides upon fragment complementation of a N- and C-intein fragment (IntN and IntC) in a protein trans-splicing reaction (Figure 5B). Additionally, one can often engineer cis-splicing into trans-splicing inteins. Protein cis-splicing gave rise to a variety of applications as it allows covalently ligating protein sequences in a solvent-free medium (in vivo or in vitro) without the requirement of additional cofactors and energy sources. Protein splicing of class 1 inteins, representing the most frequently-found examples, occurs in 4 concerted steps, involving the first intein residue (Cys 1 or Ser 1), the first residue of the C‑terminal extein (Cys/Ser/Thr +1), and the last intein residue (typically Asn) (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 6.\nConventional protein splicing mechanism of class 1\ninteins. Step 1: N-S acyl shift of the Cys 1 (in some cases Ser\n1) and the N-terminal extein to form a linear thioester. Step 2:\nTrans-esterification of Cys +1 (in some cases Ser/Thr +1) to a branched\nintermediate where the N- and C-exteins are already covalently connected\nand the intein is still attached. Step 3: Asn cyclization into a\nsuccinimide, thereby releasing the intein. Step 4: Spontaneous O-N shift\nrearrangement into the energetically-favorable peptide bond (not\nintein-catalyzed). Figure modified from Friedel et al., 2019.\n\nSplit inteins in particular found a wide range of applications including their use for protein labeling, protein semi-synthesis, protein purification, protein cyclization, or for engineering protein logic gates. Figure 7 summarizes some recent examples of developments utilizing split intein technologies (Friedel et al., 2019).\n\nFigure 7.\nApplications of split intein technologies. Bi-specific\nantibodies ligated in vitro using split inteins and individual Fab\nfragments. Biosensors to detect caspases. In\nvivo cyclization of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen2 abolishes\nfluorescence. Cleavage of the engineered DEVD sequence by caspases\nreleases the cyclic tension, resulting in fluorescence. Gene\ntherapy facilitated by individual packaging of two split CRISPR\nCas9 enzyme fragments into adeno associated viral vectors (AAVs),\nthereby respecting the viral packaging capacity. Intein trans splicing\nreconstitutes the Cas9 enzyme upon co-infection of a target cell with\nboth vectors.\n\nAQUA Cloning\nThe implementation of synthetic biology approaches, for example to the study of cell signaling, demands a wide variety of constructs, including complex combinations of synthetic protein modules, promoters, reporters, etc. The cloning of numerous constructs is time and cost demanding, therefore novel cloning approaches are necessary to simplify the engineering process. One of such methods is AQUA Cloning (Figure 8). During the practical part you will be introduced into this technique: Multiple DNA fragments sharing 20-60 bp overlap can easily be assembled into vectors in E. coli cells, based on in vivo recombination, omitting the need for enzymes commonly mediating the DNA cloning reaction in a test tube. In the practical course you will use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AQUA Cloning as well as conventional restriction and ligation cloning to construct bacterial vectors encoding a split intein-based protein logic gate for an experiment in the following week. At the same time, you will engineer suitable control vectors. The resulting vectors will be analyzed using analytical restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by Sanger sequencing.\n\nFigure 8.\nAQUA Cloning. Advanced quick assembly cloning is a\nsimple yet versatile cloning method (Beyer et al., 2015).\n(a) DNA parts are produced by PCR, or restriction\ndigest (or both). Oligonucleotides are designed to contribute flanking\nhomologous regions to adjacent DNA fragments of optimally 32 bp in\nlength. DNA parts are assembled into a circular plasmid by\nsequence-determined directionality in vivo by E. coli.\n(b) AQUA Cloning work-flow. (1) DNA parts are generated\nby PCR amplification, or derive from an enzymatic digestion. (2) Next,\nDNA parts are purified by gel-electrophoresis and (3) mixed and simply\nincubated in water prior to transformation into chemically competent\nE. coli Top10 cells for in vivo assembly. (4) Finally,\nthe obtained colonies are confirmed for correct assembly by standard\nmethods such as analytical PCR, restriction digest, and/or comprehensive\nsequencing.\n\nTransfection of Mammalian Cells\nThe process of introducing nucleic acids into mammalian cells by non-viral methods is defined as transfection. By using various chemicals, lipid-based or physical methods, this gene transfer technology is a powerful tool to study gene function and protein expression in the context of a cell. Basically, transfection is a method that overcomes the challenge of introducing molecules with a negative charge (e.g. the phosphate backbone of DNA) into cells with a negatively charged membrane.\nIons like calcium or cationic lipid-based reagents coat the DNA, thus creating an overall positive charge that facilitates uptake of the DNA-transfection reagent complex across the cell membrane (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9.\nTransfection using chemical reagents. A) Common\ncationic transfection reagents for the generation of reagent: DNA\ncomplexes with a net positive charge. B) Overview of\nthe transfection mechanism. DNA is complexed with the cationic reagent.\nThe positively charged complexes associate to the negatively charged\nmembrane and are taken up by endocytosis. Upon escape from the endosome,\nthe DNA is free to enter the nucleus (e.g., during cell division).\nFigure created with BioRender.com\n\nIn the practical course polyethylenimine (PEI) will be employed to exemplify transfection using chemical reagents.\nPEI is a poly-cationic polymer that is mixed with the DNA in a ratio that ensures the formation of complexes that carry a net positive charge. These cationic complexes interact with the negatively charged cell-surface and are taken up by endocytosis. Inside the endosome, PEI acts as a proton sponge, preventing acidification that is required for the activity of endosomal nucleases (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 10.\nPolyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated transfection of mammalian\ncells. (a) Chemical structure (b) Mechanism of\nPEI-mediated transfection. The positively charged PEI:DNA complexes are\ntaken up by endocytosis. Inside the endosome PEI prevents acidification,\nwhich eventually leads to rupture of the endosome and liberation of the\nDNA into the cytoplasm.\n\nGenome Engineering of Mammalian Cells\nUpon transfection into mammalian cells, nucleic acids can contribute to the genetic programming and instruct cells to execute or alter particular activities. Commonly, either RNA- or DNA-molecules are employed, which in most cases perform their biological function in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Current RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines, for example, rely on mRNA which upon cell uptake, undergoes ribosomal translation into fragments of the viral spike protein in the cytosol. For the production of biopharmaceuticals and research purposes in cell lines, DNA plasmids are commonly used, which require nuclear entry in order to reach the cell compartment where RNA transcription takes place (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11.\nExample of a mammalian cell plasmid including mammalian cell-specific,\nas well as bacterial features.\n\nBoth examples lead to a transient activity of the transfected genetic material. However, over time, the RNA/DNA will be cleared, usually within a time frame of a few days. In rare cases, transfected DNA can integrate at random positions into the cell genome (roughly in 1 out of 1.000 transfected cells, strongly depending on the cell, construct, and the exact experimental conditions). By using additional eukaryotic antibiotic resistance genes encoded on the transfected plasmid, one can positively select for these cells. During the past years, several methods have been developed that facilitate the targeted integration of genetic material into mammalian cells or the specific alteration of the cellular genomes. During the theoretical parts of the course, you will have the possibility to familiarize yourself with some examples spanning this topic. Methods to integrate genetic information into cell genomes for example rely on (i) the above-mentioned random DNA integration, (ii) viral gene vehicles, e.g. using lentiviral systems harboring reverse transcriptases and integrases, (iii) homologous recombination-based techniques including the use of recombinases or designer endonucleases and homology templates containing the desired genetic information, or (iv) transposase-technologies originating from transposons (“jumping genes”) which excise and integrate genetic information. Table Table 1 summarizes particular properties of these four groups.\nExperiment II of this practical course will introduce you to a blue light-sensitive optogenetic gene expression system. Here, you will use mammalian cells that have genomic integrations for the required optogenetic switches and the target gene, which will be expressed upon stimulation with light. These cells were generated using the Sleeping Beauty SB100X transposase, as explained in Figure 12. “Sleeping Beauty” refers to a transposase that was originally identified as an inactive enzyme in salmonid fish. Targeted mutagenesis, however, restored the activity after a long evolutionary sleep, and rounds of directed evolution finally yielded a hyperactive transposase enzyme, which is nowadays widely used for genome engineering purposes (Mátés et al., 2009).\n\nFigure 12.\nMode of function of SB100X Sleeping Beauty-catalyzed\ntransposition. Cotransfection of plasmids (i) containing a\ngenetic cargo which is flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), and\n(ii) a transiently-expressed SB100X transposase gene leads to\ntransposition of the cargo into the cell genome. SB100X excises the\ngenetic cargo from the plasmid and integrates it at random positions (TA\nsites) into the host genome.

		"content": "Experiment I: Molecular Cloning of Bacterial Inducible Plasmids\nSupervisors: Dominic Schirmer, Josepha Grewer, Micail David Müller\nConstructing recombinant genes within plasmids facilitates their recovery, ex-vivo genetic engineering, and shuttling into different desired strains or hosts. Recombinant DNA technologies represent the foundation for generating constitutive or inducible expression systems for the study of heterologous genes in different systems of interest.\nIn this first experimental part, we will design the required vectors for Experiment III, the design of protein logic gates based on protein trans-splicing in bacteria. For this purpose, we will use two different molecular DNA cloning techniques:\nA. Restriction and ligation cloning. This technique relies on the presence of restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites flanking the desired insert and at the specified locations within the recipient plasmid. The REs will generate double-stranded DNA cuts, resulting in either cohesive or blunt ends in both DNA sequences through two independent reactions. Subsequently, the digested fragments will be purified and ligated using T4 DNA ligase, an enzyme that facilitates the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent 5’ phosphate and 3’-OH ends. This process will occur prior to the transformation of chemically competent E. coli TOP10 bacterial cells for subsequent plasmid amplification and selection. The T4 DNA ligase will thus conduct the repair of the broken DNA, culminating in the assembly of the desired new vector (Figure 13).\nB. Advanced Quick Assembly (AQUA) Cloning. In contrast to conventional restriction/ligation cloning, this technique allows us to design a vector independently of the presence of suitable RE sites or the use of DNA restriction enzymes and ligases. This versatile and inexpensive technique relies on in-vivo DNA recombination within E. coli and therefore, requires DNA fragments that share homologous overlapping region of 20-60 bp at the junction sites. The homology region can for example be generated by PCR using appropriate primers that add these sequences to the products (Figure 13). AQUA Cloning can also be used to clone multiple DNA fragments simultaneously, reminiscent to other “DNA assembly cloning” methods. Additionally, a combination of restriction of the backbone and PCR amplification of the insert (as we will see in our exercise) can be used.\nEach group will perform one ligation and one AQUA cloning experiment from one of the four plasmids:\n\nGroups 1 and 2: pDD259.\nGroups 3 and 4: pDD260.\nGroups 5 and 6: pDD261.\nGroups 7 and 8: pDD262.\n\nAs outlined in Figure 12, we will first perform a PCR reaction to amplify: (i) The gene encoding the fluorescent protein mCherry interrupted by the full-length NpuDnaE intein gene (Int); (ii) The mCherry gene was disrupted by a mutated (non-functional) version of the intein; (iii) A DNA fragment encoding an N-terminal portion of mCherry (mChN) fused to an N-terminal split-fragment of the intein (IntN); and (iv) a DNA fragment encoding a C-terminal portion of mCherry (mChC) fused to a C-terminal split-fragment of the intein (IntC). The destination vectors will be digested overnight with the annotated restriction enzymes to generate the so-called vector “backbones” (this step will be performed by the supervisors in advance).\nAfter gel purification of the PCR products, we will need to digest the PCR product with the same enzymes as the destination vectors to clone the genes via ligation cloning. We will then prepare a pre-mix with a 3:1 molar ratio of the corresponding fragments (insert:backbone). For the restriction/ligation protocol, remember to add T4 DNA ligase and the corresponding buffer! Following ligation, competent Top10 E. coli cells are transformed with the recombinant plasmids and subsequently spread on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics, thus facilitating the selection of positive transformants.\nThe engineered vectors will be purified and analyzed using analytical restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. We encourage you to consider beforehand which enzymes we could use to differentiate the restriction pattern expected for the original plasmids and that resulting from the digestion of the engineered vectors.\nFinally, we will select putatively correct samples and analyze them by Sanger sequencing.\n\nFigure 13.\nIllustration of the cloning strategy. Top, schematic\nrepresentation of the cloned vectors. Bottom, pRSFDuet-1 plasmid (KanR)\ndigested with BamHI and KpnI serves as backbone for\ncloning plasmids pDD259/262 and 260. The inserts for these constructs\nare the amplification products of pDD002 and pDD083 with the primers\noDD561 and oDD562; or the PCR product of pDD002 with oDD561 and oDD563,\nrespectively.\n\nA third insert amplified from pDD002 with the primer oDD564 and oDD565 will be cloned into pHBBAD090 backbone, previously digested with NdeI and HindIII, to obtain pDD261. The primers add the required homology regions to the digested vector backbones during the PCR reaction. Alternatively, the PCR products can be digested using the indicated enzymes for ligation cloning. Both approaches result in the same vectors.

		"content": "Experiment II: Optogenetic Gene Expression Using Stably-Engineered Mammalian Cells\nSupervisors: Benjamin McLean, Daniel Wiebensohn, Miriam Labusch\nThe objective of this experiment is to learn how to control and analyze the induction of gene expression via an optogenetic tool in mammalian cells. To this end, foreign genes encoding the photo-switch and a light-inducible reporter encoding a gene of interest were previously introduced into the genome of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. We will treat this customized cell line with light and dark and quantify the reporter expression over a time course of 24 hours.\nTransient transfection is an efficient method for preliminary reporter assays. CHO-K1 cells normally achieve high transfection rates and express recombinant proteins in large scale when using polyethylenimine (PEI)-based transient transfection methods (see introduction Figure 7). In contrast to many commercial transfection agents, PEI is inexpensive yet very efficient for a range of mammalian cell lines. However, the transfection efficiency can be affected by various parameters (cell type, number of plasmids, DNA amount, DNA quality, etc.). Additionally, in transiently transfected cells, the foreign DNA rarely integrates into the host genome and consequently does not replicate, leading to an eventual loss through cycles of cell division over several days.\nStable genomic integration is often the preferred option as the foreign gene becomes part of the genome which allows for greater process consistency and long-term protein expression. However, the generation of stable cell lines is a time-consuming and expensive process (see Experiment V). In this experiment, we will provide a stably-engineered CHO-K1 cell line generated using a sequential genomic integration of two vectors (Figure 15). One vector encodes an optogenetic LOVpep/ePDZ-based split transcription factor system under the selection of puromycin, and the other a SEAP reporter under the selection of Hygromycin. The principle of generating stable cell lines using the Sleeping Beauty transposase is explained in the introduction part (Figure 12).\nThe following experiment will be about handling mammalian cell culture as well as the analysis of a light-induced reporter gene. The human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a reporter has tremendous advantages. SEAP is very stable, and its secretion into the medium allows a convenient and non-invasive way of acquiring samples. Furthermore, it is a quantitative reporter for gene expression because the SEAP activity in the supernatant of transfected CHO-K1 cells is proportional to shifts in intracellular SEAP mRNA levels. The activity of promoters/enhancers and other elements can be measured due to their direct correlation to SEAP secretion. Finally, the SEAP phosphatase is heat persistent and endures a temperature of 65°C, whereas other phosphatases degrade at this temperature. Therefore, heat treatment can be used to selectively enrich SEAP in samples that might contain additional phosphatases.\n\nFigure 15.\nMode of function of the optogenetic gene switch in\ngenomically-engineered cells. A) An engineered\nLOV2 domain from Avena sativa phototropin 1 was fused to the\nC-terminus of the E-protein (erythromycin resistance protein), thus\ntethering it to a response construct harboring 8 repeats of the E\nbinding sequence (etr8) upstream of a synthetic minimal\npromoter, while the PDZ interaction domain was fused to the VP16\ntransactivation domain. In the dark, the epitope tag of the LOVpep\nfusion protein is inaccessible for the PDZ domain. Consequently, gene\nexpression is off. Blue light (460 nm) illumination leads to the\nunwinding of the C-terminal Jα helix of LOVpep and makes the epitope tag\naccessible for binding of the PDZ domain. Due to the recruitment of the\ntransactivator VP16 to the minimal promoter, the transcriptional\nmachineries are recruited, and the SEAP gene‑expression is induced.\nSchematic representation of the vector encoding the photo-switch\n(B) and the SEAP reporter gene (C)\nboth flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs).\n\nMaterials\n\nTable 12.\nMaterials used in Experiment II.\n\nItem\nComposition/Concentration\nApplication\n\nHam’s Medium\n90% Ham’s tissue culture medium F12 (PAN-Biotech), 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS, PAN-Biotech), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin\n(Gibco).\nGrowth medium\n\nTrypsin/EDTA in PBS\n0.05% Trypsin/ 0.02% EDTA in PBS; (PAN Biotech Cat.\nNo. P10-023500)\nCell dissociation\n\n1x PBS\n2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.0 mM\nNa2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl in dH2O.\nRemoval of dead cells\n\n2x SEAP buffer\n20 mM homoarginine, 1 mM MgCl2, 21% (v/v) diethanolamine,\npH 9.8\nInhibition of endogenous phosphatases\n\npNPP\n120 mM in dH2O\nSEAP substrate\n\nProtocol\nDay 3: Seeding Mammalian Cells\nPreparation of materials:\n\nPre-warm Ham’s medium, 1X PBS, and Trypsin/EDTA in 37°C water bath.\n15 mL falcons, stripette tips (10 mL), 1000 µL and 200 µL tips (sterilized).\n24-well cell-culture plates for cell seeding.\nFuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber.\n\nProcedure:\n\nPerform all steps under green safelight to avoid exposure to ambient light.\nCheck cell confluency briefly under the microscope.\nIntroduce medium, PBS, and Trypsin into the laminar flow bench and screw all lids open\n(do not remove the lids).\nRemove supernatant (with yellow tip using the pump).\nTilt the petri dish toward you gently, remove the supernatant, and avoid touching the cells.\nAdd 2 mL PBS to wash, then remove it.\nAdd 2 mL Trypsin and ensure that all cells are covered.

		"content": "Experiment III: Protein Trans-Splicing for Bacterial Logic Gate Design\nSupervisors: Josepha Grewer, Maria Evangelopoulou, Hannes Beyer\nIn this experiment, we adapt the naturally occurring protein cis- and trans-splicing catalyzed by the DnaE intein from Nostoc punctiforme (NpuDnaE intein) to engineer a synthetic protein logic gate. As previously explained in section 1.1.2, inteins are protein domains with autocatalytic activity that give rise to a reconstituted functional protein after self-excising from the host or precursor protein. Protein splicing can occur either in cis (excision of an intein) or in trans, leading to the ligation of two individual proteins, each fused to one fragment of a split intein. In Experiment I, we have cloned the bacterial inducible plasmids that we need for this experiment (Figure 13):\n\npDD259: IPTG-inducible promoter guiding the expression of mCherry fluorescent protein hosting a cis-splicing intein.\npDD262: IPTG-inducible promoter guiding the expression of mCherry fluorescent protein hosting a cis-splicing intein with an inactivating mutation of Cys1 to Ala (C1A).\npDD260: IPTG-inducible promoter guiding the expression of the N-terminal region of mCherry fused to the N-terminal fragment of the NpuDnaE intein (IntN, N-terminal split fragment).\npDD261: Arabinose-inducible promoter guiding the expression of the C-terminal region of mCherry fused to the C-terminal fragment of the NpuDnaE intein (IntC, C-terminal split fragment).\n\nWe will transform and induce protein production in the Escherichia coli strain T7-Express using competent cells following the scheme in Figure 13:\n\nTransformation of pDD259: We will use this construct to test intein-based protein cis-splicing. Therefore, if the system is working properly, we should be able to detect mCherry fluorescence upon IPTG induction.\nTransformation of pDD262: The construct is almost identical to pDD259, except for the C1A mutation in the NpuDnaE intein to prevent the initial step (N-S acyl shift) during the protein splicing reaction.\nCo-transformation of pDD260 and pDD261: When the C- and N-terminal domains of the intein are expressed, they should interact to form a functional intein (protein trans-splicing, which will therefore be spliced to give rise to the reconstituted functional mCherry protein). Subsequently, in the cells co-transformed with these two plasmids, we should be able to detect mCherry fluorescence upon induction of expression with IPTG and arabinose. Induction with IPTG or arabinose alone, however, should not yield significant amounts of functional mCherry protein.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhat are the positive and negative controls?\nHow many conditions do we need to perform in the experiment?\n\nFigure 17.\n** Scheme for the protein trans-splicing experiment to design\nlogic gates.\n\nMaterials\n\nTable 13.\nMaterials used in Experiment III.\n\nItem\nComposition/Concentration\nApplication\n\nArabinose\n20%\nInduce expression of PBAD\n\nAmpicillin\n100 mg/mL\nSelection marker\n\nKanamycin\n50 mg/mL\nSelection marker\n\nIPTG\n1 M\nInduce expression of PT7\n\nLB-Medium\n10 g/L tryptone, 5g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, pH 7.0.\nBacteria growth medium\n\nPBS\n2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.0 mM\nNa2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl in dH2O\nBuffer used for cell diluting\n\nE. coli T7 express strain\n\nExpresses T7 RNA- polymerase\n\nProtocol\nDay 6: Transformation of Bacterial Strains\n\nThaw cells on ice (E. coli T7 Express strain).\nAdd ~1 µL of plasmid DNA (see group distribution below) on top of cells (for co-transformation, add 2 µL each).\nIncubate on ice for ~10 min.\nHeat shock at 42°C for 45 s.\nImmediately incubate on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 250 µL LB-medium.\nShake for ~1 h at 37°C.\nStreak out 10 µL (20 µL for co-transformation) on antibiotic-LB-Agar plates (use correct antibiotics!).\nIncubate at 37°C overnight.\n\nDay 7: Intein Experiment in E. coli\n\nTable 14.\nExperimental setup distribution.

		"content": "Experiment IV: Intein-Catalyzed Protein Domain Swapping at the Plasma Membrane\nSupervisors: Cha San Koh, Daniel Wiebensohn, Hannes Beyer\nThis experiment aims to induce either the addition or exchange of two protein domains at the plasma membrane of mammalian HeLa cells using split intein technology. Here, the construct design determines whether an intein trans-splicing reaction yields one of the two possible outcomes. To determine the localization of the two proteins, we will use the green fluorescent protein GFP and the red fluorescent protein mCherry, allowing for their analysis via confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 18). Both fluorescent proteins are genetically fused to one half of the DnaE intein from Nostoc punctiforme (NpuDnaE intein split fragments, abbreviated as IntN and IntC for the N- and C-terminal fragment, respectively), which you also used in Experiment III. GFP is additionally fused to an N-terminal myristylation/palmitylation signal derived from the Src kinase Lck, leading to cotranslational myristoylation at glycine residue 2 and then posttranslational palmitoylation at cysteine residues 3 and 5 (Akimzhanov and Boehning, 2015). Modification with these fatty acids leads to the attachment of the protein to inner cell membranes.\nIn the experiment, you will transiently transfect human HeLa cells with different combinations of the following plasmids encoding two versions of the membrane-attached GFP protein fused to IntN, or cytosolic mCherry fused to IntC. While we expect GFP to localize at the membrane and mCherry in the cytosol when transfected into cells, their cotransfection should induce the protein splicing reaction, which we will observe by confocal microscopy.\n\nFigure 18.\nDomain swapping at the plasma membrane. Split\nintein-catalyzed protein trans-splicing (PTS) reaction either leading to\nthe addition (left), or exchange (right) of GFP and mCherry at the\nplasma membrane, depending on the domain order of the GFP constructs\n(pDD130 vs pDD132). The IntC-fused mCherry construct pDD131\nis identical in both approaches.\n\nIn cells, many relevant signaling pathways initiate or pass through microdomains at the plasma membrane, often linking the perception of extracellular signals via membrane integral receptors to the cytosol. Therefore, modulating the localization of proteins involved in cell signaling represents an important tool to regulate cellular behavior. However, the induction of protein domain swapping might likewise be employed to regulate diverse cellular mechanisms, for example, by exchanging antagonistically functional protein domains, such as activators and repressors.\nMaterials\n\nTable 15.\nMaterials used in Experiment IV.\n\nItem\nComposition/Concentration\nApplication\n\nArabinose\n20%\nInduce expression of PBAD\n\nAmpicillin\n100 mg/mL\nSelection marker\n\nKanamycin\n50 mg/mL\nSelection marker\n\nIPTG\n1 M\nInduce expression of PT7\n\nLB-Medium\n10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10\ng/L NaCl, pH 7.0.\nBacteria growth medium\n\nPBS\n2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH₂PO₄, 8.0 mM Na₂HPO₄,\n137 mM NaCl in dH₂O\nBuffer used for cell diluting\n\nE. coli T7 express strain\n\nExpresses T7 RNA- polymerase\n\nTable 16.\nPlasmid DNA (Minipreps)\n\nName\nDescription\nConcentration\n\npDD130\nPSV40-LckM/P-GFP-IntN-pA\n100 ng/µL\n\npDD131\nPSV40-IntC-mCherry-pA\n100 ng/µL\n\npDD132\nPSV40-LckM/P-IntN-GFP-pA\n100 ng/µL\n\nTable 17.\nMedia\n\nName\nDescription/Composition\n\nDMEMcomplete\nDulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS, PAN-Biotech), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin\n(Gibco).\n\nOpti-MEMTM\nOptimized minimum essential medium (Gibco), serum-free.\n\nLysogeny broth (LB)\n10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, pH 7.0.\n\nLB-agar plates (Amp)\n20 g/L Bacto Agar in 500 mL dH2O, 100 µg/mL\nAmpicillin.\n\nTable 18.\nCells\n\nName\nDescription\n\nHeLa\nH. sapiens cervix carcinoma derivative, epithelial-like,\n(ACC 57, DSMZ).\n\nE. coli TOP10\nChemically-competent cells.

Use 1 µL of the provided plasmid DNA per transformation into one tube of competent E. coli TOP10 cells. Spread 50 µL of culture on one LB-Amp plate (asymmetrically, you want to be able to pick a single colony the next day). Incubate the plate overnight at 37°C.\nDay 8: Culture Inoculation\n\nAdd 100 µL of Ampicillin to one Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL LB medium.\nUsing a sterile 200 µL pipette tip, pick one colony from your transformation on day 7 and inoculate the medium.\nShake the flask overnight at 37°C, shaking at 180 rpm.\n\nDay 9: Culture Harvesting\n\nHarvest 100 mL culture by centrifugation twice for 5 min at 5,000 xg at RT in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nRemove the supernatant (SN).\nStore the cell pellet at -20°C.\n\nDay 10: Plasmid Midiprep\n\nAdd 8 mL of buffer RES supplemented with RNAase (M. Nagel, 60 µg/mL) to the Falcon tube, thoroughly resuspend the cells.\nAdd 8 mL lysis buffer LYS (if you notice precipitated SDS, warm it first until it dissolves). Mix by inverting 6 to 8 times. DO NOT VORTEX.\nIncubate 5 min at RT.\nAdd 8 mL neutralization buffer NEU. Mix immediately by inverting the tube 6 to 8 times. DO NOT VORTEX.\nCentrifuge 10 min, 12,000 xg at RT. (Afterwards, pre-chill the centrifuge at 4°C for a later step. Do not forget to add the tube adapters.)\nMeanwhile, equilibrate the column/filter with 10 mL equilibration buffer EQU (apply the buffer onto the rim of the column filter, not the center), and allow the column to drain by gravity flow.\nLoad supernatant on the filter/column, and allow the column to drain by gravity flow.\nAdd 10 mL equilibration buffer EQU for the 1st wash (on the rim of the filter).\nDiscard the column filter.\nAdd 10 mL of wash buffer WASH for the 2nd wash (directly on the middle of the column).\nPlace a 15 mL Falcon tube under the column and elute the DNA with 5 mL elution buffer ELU.\nAdd 3.5 mL of isopropanol to the eluate. Vortex thoroughly.\nCentrifuge 30 min, 12,000 xg at 4°C. (Afterwards, set the centrifuge to RT for the next step).\nDiscard SN by decanting (Be careful at this step. You should see a small white DNA pellet, which you do not want to lose). Show the pellet to your supervisor to discuss in what volume you should resuspend the pellet in the last step.\nWash the DNA pellet with 2 mL 70% EtOH.\nCentrifuge 5 min, 12,000 xg at RT.\nCarefully discard the SN using the pipette. The pellet is usually very loose at this step.\nAir-dry the pellet (a few hours at RT, or in the oven at 65°C for approx. 5 min).\nResuspend with 70–120 µL ddH2O (sterile).\nIncubate 30 min at 37°C, resuspend by gentle pipetting.\nDilute the DNA 1:10 and determine the concentration using the nanodrop (eventually adjust the concentration to 2 µg/µL).\nStore the extracted plasmids at -20°C.\n\nDay 11: Seeding HeLa Cells on Glass Coverslips\nThis step should be performed only by one member of each group in order to prevent overcrowding in the cell culture room. Together with the supervisors, you will prepare a shared cell suspension. Each present group member will then seed the required number of cells in a 24-well plate (one plate per group)\n\nPrepare a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 8 mL prewarmed DMEMcomplete medium.\nRemove supernatant (pump).\nGently add 2 mL prewarmed PBS, and tilt the plate to wash the cells. Remove the PBS again.\nAdd 2 mL Trypsin and incubate the plate for 5 min at 37°C.\nDetach and resuspend the cells using a 1000 µL pipette. Transfer the suspension to the prepared medium. (The serum in the medium will inactivate the Trypsin).\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min, 300 xg.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL fresh medium.\nPrepare the Countess 3 counting chamber.\nAdd 10 µL of the cell suspension to the cup.\nCount cells using the Countess 3.\nThe Countess 3 provides information on the concentration (cells/mL) and viability (in %) of the cells. Please record this information for your protocol.\nDetermine the number of cells: counted cells/mL * 10 mL (volume) = total cells.\nSeed HeLa cells as follows:\n\nPrepare a cell suspension with a concentration of 60,000 cells/mL (→ c2) by dilution with DMEMcomplete medium. Prepare 35 mL (→ v2) of cell suspension in order to have enough for all groups. Use a 50 mL Falcon tube. The required dilution volume v1 can be calculated according to the formula c1 * v1 = c2 * v2.\nSeed 500 µL of cell suspension (containing 30,000 HeLa cells) into each well of a 24-well plate containing a glass cover slip (prepared by supervisors in advance). Each group should seed 6 wells into an individual plate.\n\nTable 21.\nWell plate layout: Seed wells 1, 2, and 3 in a 24-well plate (6 wells\nper group).\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nA\nx\nx\nx\n\nB\nx\nx\nx\n\nC\n\nD\n\nPlace the cell culture plate into the 37°C incubator to allow them to attach to the glass coverslip for the PEI transfection on day 12.\n\nDay 12: PEI Transfection\n\nPer well, dilute 0.75 µg of DNA in OptiMEM to a final volume of 50 µL (remember your Midi-prep concentration). Please check Table 22 and Table 23 for further information.\nWhen transfecting multiple plasmids for the same setup, divide the total DNA amount (0.75 µg) by the number of plasmids which are transfected (equal plasmid load). Note: keep ca. 0.75 µg as total DNA amount; the ratio of DNA: PEI is important for the transfection efficiency!\nPer well, dilute 2.5 µL of PEI solution in OptiMEM to a final volume of 50 µL. Vortex. Please check Table 22 and Table 23 for further information.\nAdd an equal volume of PEI solution to the DNA solution.\nVortex the solution immediately and thoroughly for 10 s. Complexation of PEI with DNA, into small particles able to enter the cell during transfection, is dependent on thorough mixing at this step.\nIncubate for 15 min at RT.\nPer well, add the premixed 100 µL PEI/DNA mix drop-wise to each well.

		"content": "Experiment V: Engineering Chemically Regulated Gene Switch Technology in Stable Mammalian Cell Culture\nSupervisors: Maria Evangelopoulou, Miriam Labusch, Benjamin McLean\nAim\nThe aim of this experiment is to investigate the dose-dependent induction of NeonGreen expression using the tetracycline-inducible system and quantify fluorescence levels via flow cytometry. Each group will generate stable transgenic CHO-K1 lines carrying both the reporter and a TetR-based tTA variant, and will then measure fluorescence in a control sample without tetracycline, as well as in one experimental sample containing a given tetracycline concentration to compare expression levels.\nBackground\nTetracycline-Inducible Expression System (Tet System)\nThe tetracycline (Tet) system is a widely used inducible gene expression system that enables precise control over the transcription of a gene of interest (T. Das et al. 2016). It is based on regulatory elements derived from the Escherichia coli tetracycline resistance operon. The system typically consists of two components:\n\nA tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA or rtTA-reverse rTA), which binds to tetracycline response elements (TRE) upstream of the gene of interest.\nThe target gene, in this case coding for the fluorescent protein neonGreen, downstream of the TRE.\n\nFigure 19.\nSchematic representation of the Tet-On system. The\nTet-On 3G protein is constitutively expressed under the control of the\nCAG promoter. Upon addition of tetracycline, the Tet-On 3G protein\nundergoes a conformational change that enables it to bind to the TRE3G\npromoter, thereby activating transcription and inducing NeonGreen\nexpression.\n\nIn our experiment, we will implement the Tet-On system in a 3G (third-generation) configuration, which uses an optimized reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator containing viral transactivation domains thus constituting a trascriptional regulator functional in eukaryotic cells. The third generation achieves tight regulation and high sensitivity to tetracycline induction (Randolph et al. 2017). In the Tet-On system, gene expression is activated in the presence of tetracycline or its derivative doxycycline. When tetracycline is added to the cells, it binds to the Tet (rtTA/tTA) protein and alters its conformation, enabling it to interact with the TRE promoter and thereby activate gene transcription (in our case: NeonGreen). The amount of tetracycline added determines the extent of activation, allowing for dose-dependent regulation of expression.\nWhy Different Concentrations Matter\nUsing different tetracycline concentrations enables fine-tuning of expression levels. At low concentrations, only a small fraction of rtTA will be activated, resulting in weak expression. Higher concentrations lead to stronger induction and higher levels of fluorescent protein. However, once all Tet proteins are bound by tetracycline, the system reaches saturation, and further increases in concentration will no longer enhance expression levels. Excessively high concentrations may further cause off-target effects and cellular stress leading to non-linear responses. This dose-dependent approach therefore helps to:\n\nEstablish induction thresholds\nAnalyze the dynamic range of the system\nInvestigate potential cytotoxicity or system leakage\nDetermine optimal working concentrations for controlled expression\n\nFlow Cytometry for Quantifying Fluorescent Reporters\nAnalyzing the induction with the flow cytometer\nTo measure NeonGreen expression on a single-cell level, a flow cytometer is used. Flow cytometry allows rapid analysis of thousands of individual cells as they pass through a laser beam in a fluid stream. When the laser excites the fluorescent reporter (NeonGreen), the emitted light is detected by photomultiplier tubes and converted into numerical fluorescence intensity values. This enables quantitative measurement of expression levels within cell populations.\nAdvantages of flow Cytometry\n\nSingle-cell resolution allows detection of heterogeneous expression patterns.\nHigh throughput: thousands of cells per second can be analyzed.\nQuantitative: provides precise fluorescence intensity values.\nMulti-parameter analysis: expression can be correlated with other markers (e.g., viability or cell cycle).\n\nStable Cell Lines and Their Advantages\nStable cell lines are cell populations that have stably integrated foreign DNA into their genome, allowing long-term and consistent expression of the gene of interest. Unlike transient transfections, where the introduced DNA is only temporarily present and expression levels vary between cells and over time, stable lines provide reproducible and uniform expression profiles across experiments. Testing the tet-inducible system in stable lines offers several advantages: it ensures reliable control of gene expression, reduces variability between samples, and allows for more accurate quantification of induction levels. Additionally, stable integration enables long-term experiments and repeated induction studies without the need to transfect cells again, making it ideal for analyzing dose-dependent responses and optimizing tetracycline concentrations.\nMaterial\n\nTable 24.\nMaterials for Experiment V.\n\nItem\nComposition/Concentration\nApplication\n\nHam’s Medium\n90% Ham’s tissue culture medium F12 (PAN-Biotech), 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS, PAN-Biotech), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin\n(Gibco).\nGrowth medium\n\nTrypsin\n0.05% Trypsin\nCell dissociation\n\n1x PBS\n2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8.0 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl in dH2O.\nRemoval of dead cells &amp; Dilution of cells for measurement\n\nPuromycin\n10 mg/mL Puromycin\nAntibiotic for selection\n\nTetracycline\n1000 µg/mL Tetracycline\nInduction of neonGreen expression\n\nPolyethylenimine (PEI)\n1 mg/mL polyethylenimine\nTransfection reagent\n\nOptiMEM\nOptiMEM reduced serum medium (Gibco).\nTransfection medium\n\nTable 25.\nUsed plasmids prepared by the supervisors.\n\nName\nDescription\nConcentration\n\npDD312\nPCAG-TetOn3G-Tbg - Ptre3gv-mneonGreen-pA\n1926 ng/µL\n\npME001\nPCMV-PB transposase-pA\n2126 ng/µL\n\nProtocol\nDay 2 - Cell Seeding (will be performed by your supervisors)\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed HAMs medium, 1x PBS, and Trypsin (37°C water bath)\n15 mL falcons, 10 mL stripette tips, 200 µL and 1000 µL sterile tips\n6-well culture plate for cell seeding\nFuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber\n\nProcedure\n\nPrepare the clean bench: clean with ethanol, then introduce medium, PBS and trypsin, falcons and tips by vigorously spraying them down with ethanol.\nCheck cell confluency under microscope (ideally around 70 - 90%) before introducing the plate into the clean bench.\nRemove supernatant using the pump with a yellow tip → tilt the petri dish toward you and remove supernatant without touching the cells.\nAdd 2 mL PBS to wash the cells and remove it.\nAdd 2 mL trypsin and ensure all cells are covered → incubate for 5 min at 37°C in the incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare a 15 mL falcon tube with 5 mL HAMs medium.\nAfter the 5 min incubation, make sure to fully detach cells by resuspending the trypsin solution and transfer everything into the freshly prepared falcon with medium.\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min at 300 xg.\nMeanwhile, prepare the Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber in order to count the cells.\nRemove the supernatant from the cells using the pump.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL of fresh HAMs medium.\nCount cells with Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber using ~ 15 µL → you need to count at least 4 squares and calculate the amount for the whole chamber (16 squares, depth = 0.2 mm, A = 0.0625 mm2, 1 mm3 = 1 µL).\n\n① Calculate Original Cell Concentration (Corig)\nFirst, determine the concentration of your stock solution in cells/mL. For a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber (0.2 mm depth, 1 mm2 large square area), the volume of one large square is 0.2 μL (which is 1/5,000 of a mL).\nCorig (cells/mL)=Total Cells CountedNumber of Squares Counted×5,000×Dilution Factor② Define Target Seeding Concentration (Ctarget)\nNext, calculate the concentration of the working solution you need for your plates.\nCtarget (cells/mL)=Target Cells per WellVolume per Well (mL)\nExample: If seeding 50,000 cells in 500 μL (0.5 mL) per well, your target concentration is 50,000÷0.5=100,000 cells/mL.\n\n③ Calculate Total Master Mix Volume (Vtotal)\nTo avoid running out of suspension due to pipetting inaccuracies, always calculate for your planned wells plus a safety margin (Wextra, typically 10% extra or 1-2 extra wells).\nWtotal=Wplanned+WextraVtotal (mL)=Wtotal×Volume per Well (mL)④ Calculate Mixing Volumes (Vsuspension and Vmedium)\nFinally, use the C1V1=C2V2 formula to determine how much original cell suspension to mix with fresh medium to create your master mix.\nDetermine volume of original cell suspension needed:\nVsuspension (mL)=Ctarget×VtotalCorigDetermine volume of fresh medium needed to reach final volume:\nVmedium (mL)=Vtotal−VsuspensionNext Step at the Bench: Add Vsuspension of your cells to a sterile tube containing Vmedium of fresh medium. Mix gently, then pipette your standard volume (e.g., 500 μL) into each well.\nDay 3 - Stable Transfection\nFor this part of the experiment three groups will form one big group to transfect one well per group, so in the end we would have three transfected wells. These groups will then share the responsibility of passaging and selecting the cells until the day of seeding for the experiment.\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed OptiMEM (37°C water bath)\nPolyethyleneimine (PEI)\n1.5 mL tubes, 10 µL, 200 µL and 1000 µL sterile tips\nCells seeded in 6-well plate\nPlasmids: pME001 (piggybac transposase), pDD312 (tet inducible NeonGreen expression)\n\nFigure 20.\nStable transfection calculation sheet.\n\nProcedure\n\nCalculate the volumes needed for OptiMEM and the respective plasmids.\nPrepare OptiMEM-DNA mix based on your calculations and vortex.\nPrepare PEI/OptiMEM Mix.\nAdd PEI/OptiMEM to your DNA mix and vortex for 10 s.\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd 500 µL dropwise to each well and distribute by moving plate from side to side.\nMedium exchange ~4 h after transfection.\nAspirate medium and add 2 mL fresh DMEM.\n\nDay 5 – Split Cells and Start Selection\nTwo days after transfection, the selection process is initiated using the antibiotic encoded in the selection cassette of the transfected plasmid pDD312. In this case, the antibiotic is puromycin. In addition to the antibiotic resistance gene, the selection cassette also encodes a blue fluorescent protein (BFP), which serves as an additional selection marker. During the selection period, the efficiency and progression of selection can be monitored by visualizing BFP expression under a fluorescence microscope.\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed HAMs medium, 1x PBS, and Trypsin (37°C water bath)\n15 mL falcons, 10 mL stripette tips, 200 µL and 1000 µL sterile tips\n10 cm petri dish\nPuromycin (10 µg/mL)\n\nProcedure\n\nPrepare the clean bench: clean with ethanol, then introduce medium, PBS and trypsin, falcons and tips by vigorously spraying them down with ethanol.\nCheck cell confluency under microscope (ideally around 70 - 90%) and fluorescence of your BFP fluorescence reporter, before introducing the plate into the clean bench.\nRemove supernatant using the pump with a yellow tip → tilt the plate toward you and remove supernatant without touching the cells.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to wash the cells and remove it.\nAdd 1 mL trypsin and ensure all cells are covered → incubate for 5 min at 37°C in the incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare a 15 mL falcon tube with 3 mL HAMs medium.\nAfter the 5 min incubation, make sure to fully detach cells by resuspending the trypsin solution and transfer everything into the freshly prepared falcon with medium.\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min at 300 xg.\nMeanwhile prepare a 10 cm petri dish with 10 mL HAMs medium.\nRemove supernatant and add 1 mL of fresh medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension onto your petri dish.\nAdd 10 µL of puromycin (10 µg/mL) and distribute cells and antibiotic by moving the plate (e.g., gently rocking).\n\nDay 6 - Change Medium or Split Culture\nDepending on the transfection efficiency the transfected cells could we ready to split again.

(If cell selection is complete, it may not be necessary to add puromycin today).\n\nDay 11 - Cell Seeding for Experiment\nIn this part of the experiment, you are going to seed the generated stable cell culture into 6-well plates for the tetracycline induction. There you will be testing two conditions: one specific tetracycline concentration per group, and a negative control group (no tetracycline). This will be performed in technical triplicate for each condition. This means each group will be seeding one whole 6-well plate.\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed HAMs medium, 1x PBS, and Trypsin (37°C water bath)\n15 mL Falcons, 10 mL stripette tips, 200 µL, and 1000 µL sterile tips\n6-well plates\n\nProcedure\n\nPrepare the clean bench: clean with ethanol, then introduce medium, PBS and trypsin, falcons, and tips by vigorously spraying them down with ethanol.\nRemove supernatant using the pump with a yellow tip → tilt the plate toward you and remove supernatant without touching the cells.\nAdd 2 mL PBS to wash the cells and remove it.\nAdd 2 mL trypsin and ensure all cells are covered → incubate for 5 min at 37°C in the incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare a 15 mL falcon tube with 5 mL HAMs medium.\nAfter the 5 min incubation, make sure to fully detach cells by resuspending the trypsin solution and transfer everything into the freshly prepared falcon with medium.\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min at 300 g.\nMeanwhile, prepare the chamber for cell counting using the Countess.\nRemove supernatant and add 10 mL of fresh medium.\nMeasure the cell concentration with the supervisors using the Cell Countess.\nBased on your cell concentration, calculate how many cells you will need to seed for your experiment. You will need 250,000 cells per well.\nThe supervisors will prepare a plate of CHO-K1 control cells.\n\nDay 11 - Tetracycline Induction\nHere, we are going to induce the expression of NeonGreen using different concentrations of tetracycline. The group will be split in half: 4 groups will measure this experiment in the morning and the rest in the afternoon on day 13. The concentrations tested in the morning will be the same as in the afternoon. Note for the analysis part: show and discuss the results of the different concentrations in your protocol. The groups within the same timeslot will have to share their data with each other.\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed HAMs medium\nTetracycline (undiluted stock solution)\n\nProcedure\n\nUsing 10 µL pipette tips, add the appropriate amount of tetracycline to each well. In each 6-well plate, 3 wells will remain without tetracycline (negative control). The remaining 3 wells will receive the same amount of tetracycline each (depending on your group). The following concentrations will be tested: 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL.\n\nDay 13 - Flow Cytometry\nWhat you will need\n\nPre-warmed HAMs medium, 1x PBS, and Trypsin (37°C water bath)\n200 µL and 1000 µL sterile tips\n1.5 mL Eppi tubes\n\nPreparations before the measurement\n\nPrepare the clean bench: clean with ethanol, then introduce medium, PBS and trypsin, Falcons, and tips by vigorously spraying them down with ethanol\nRemove supernatant using the pump with a yellow tip\n→ tilt the petri dish toward you and remove supernatant without touching the cells\nAdd 500 µL PBS to wash the cells and remove it\nAdd 500 µL trypsin and ensure all cells are covered → incubate for 5 min at 37°C in the incubator\nIn the meantime: prepare + label 6 1.5 mL tubes for your measurement (labeling on the side of each tube!)\nRelease all the cells from the culture dish by pipetting/washing, and stop the trypsin reaction with 500 µL medium\nTransfer cell suspensions in designated 1.5 mL tubes\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min at 300 g\nAspirate supernatant\nResuspend with 800 µL PBS\nCytometer Measurement\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/garden-06-experiment4/\">← Previous</a> | <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/garden-08-references/\">Next →</a>",
